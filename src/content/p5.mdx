import Codepen from "react-codepen-embed";

Almost 20 years ago I lived in London, surrounded and inspired by an amazing group of digital artists. Around that time [processing](https://processing.org) came out and lowered  the bar to explore the exciting space of computational art. The framework allows you to experiment with code as a means for artistic expression. In a sense that is of course true for all coding which is how we instruct the computer to manipulate information on our behalf. Processing is one of many approaches that democratize this essential process by requiring much less expertise and skill to get started. Their own words capture it rather well: 

> Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. 

Many years later I was delighted to discover [p5.js](https://p5js.org). It is a continuation of the same principles in javascript. It makes it even easier to explore this space. Both tools have come a long way since their inceptions and combined with the  processing power available to us today you can now do things in your browser that would have been previously only possible with something like [Open Frameworks](https://openframeworks.cc) (if you need more raw power that remains a fantastic tool of choice).

There are countless other tools and frameworks out there. I was and still am attracted to these because of the people who created them and the audience they reach: Artist!

It has never been easer to get started as P5.js is of course readily available as an option in [Codepen](https://codepen.io/kohlhofer/pen/MWKEzBR) so you can experiment away with zero set up or overhead. It makes it easy to create something like the doodle shown below with a few idle moments in an evening and using nothing but a browser:
