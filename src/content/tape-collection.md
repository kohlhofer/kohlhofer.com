I support independent electronic artists by occasionally buying music they release on cassettes. These runs can be as small as 20 tapes or even one-offs. To me this is not about the unique audio quality of tape. If anything I enjoy the sense of nostalgia they provide.  The act of choosing and listening to music on this old fashioned medium is very deliberate. In a sense you are paying homage to the artistâ€“or at least that is how I feel when I get up to flip a record/tape or carefully choose my next adventure.

I release some of my own music as [longer form mixes](/tg/1) that require a similar commitment albeit in digital form. A set of [vintage tape illustrations](/tape-collection/) to go with each mix seemed a fitting visual metaphor. 

I will be expanding the collection as I make and share more music. Read on if you care about the details and [contact me](/contact) if you are interested in using them for your own projects. I may open source them since I managed to package them up as a react component that one can easily re-use. To render a cassette you simply add the following: 

    <Cassette cover="1" label="cool name for this tape" />

If you do not set the cover attribute it will pick a random one. It was easy and obvious to animate the reels. One day I may make it more dynamic but right now they just spin on endlessly.
