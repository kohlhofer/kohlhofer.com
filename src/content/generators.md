The internet is an endless source of tutorials and resources that aid you in creating whatever your thing is. Most problems you run into are just a search away. And more and more elements that used to require dedicated software or hard won skills are now readily available for the taking or conveniently packaged up in free specialized tools. This ever increasing commoditization frees you up to remain focused on the creative act and higher order challenges (whatever they may be). 

I am currently looking at web design and related technologies but find the following quote by Brian Eno on music making rather fitting: 

> "The great benefit of computer sequencers is that they remove the issue of skill, and replace it with the issue of judgement."

People who are just starting out in the creative or software industries are eager to explore. In addition most educational frameworks frown on straight up copying  someone else's solutions. Combine that with the seemingly unbound energy of youth you end up with a kind of brute force approach to reach desirable outcomes. 

In contrast experienced practitioners rarely intent to invent. They re-use and combine what has already been invited and reserve their own creative energies for that small or big incremental improvement that makes all the difference and can even shift an entire paradigm. Consequently this is often my first advice and certainly what I practice: See how far you can get by using what is already out there. 

It is frustrating to see people and teams waste time on yet another implementation of something for which there are already countless freely available better solutions. This is especially true for design patterns. 

And just to be clear this is not just about lofty design principles or open source software in general. It applies to the very mundane day to day craft, too.

Here are a few of the things I came across recently or have been using for a while that solve very specific problems:

* [Noise PNG](http://noisepng.com) helps you make transparent noise textures in seconds.
* [CSS gradient](https://cssgradient.io) makes it a cinch to explore and use CSS ready gradients.
* [Subtle patterns](https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/) is an ever increasing collection of well made subtle background patterns.

All of the above came in handy and one point or the other. Non of them achieve anything I could not do already with an existing workflow. They just make it more convenient and quick. Along the same lines you can use something like [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) to build a site without ceding control to a platform like medium. And you can deploy it in seconds with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) without setting up or maintaining a secure server. You can experiment with advanced concepts like sentiment analysis in an afternoon or play with machine learning with a bare minimum of coding knowledge by using open source tools and open APIs. 

I once built web based chess interface around the [stockfish chess engine](https://stockfishchess.org) that allowed you to analyze games and would easily beat most grand masters. It took me only days as I simply combined 3 or 4 readily available open projects (to parse positions, to integrate command line tools, etc..). My only contributions was the wiring of the pieces. That is why I ultimately did not keep it around for long.

Closing thoughts: 

* I was subjected to a code test type of interview only once and enjoyed the experience. But depending on your needs I would venture that for most situations it is a lot more valuable to see how quickly a software engineer can come up with a good solution to any given problem using google and stack overflow rather than writing effective algorithms from scratch in artificial isolation. But maybe that specific experience is behind the times already. I would hope so.
* Most of the above applies to society and the sciences at large. We are in it together and we learn from each other. Everything we build sits  atop that which came before. The only constant is change (or at least has been since the so called dark ages which may have not been all that dark according to Douglas Rushkoff in [Life, inc](https://rushkoff.com/books/life-inc/).)
